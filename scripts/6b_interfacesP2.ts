/**
 * new interfaces can be defined more concisely by extending from existing interfaces.

 * Assuming we have a 'Car' type, we can create a new type as follows:
 *
 * interface FormulaOneCar extends Car {
 *   wins: number;
 * }
 *
 * An instance of FormulaOneCar has all the attributes of Car, plus 'wins'.
 *
 * Below, define an interface for a 'Milk' data type that extends 'Grocery'.
