/**
 * Sometimes a variable could be one of a few different types. You can
 * specify this using a union type. For example, this variable
 * declaration:
 *    let fieldValue: string|null;
 * allows fieldValue to be either a string or null.
 *
 * Union types are a much better option than using the 'any' type (which permits
 * literally anything), because they specify exactly which which types
 * a value could legitimately be. Anything outside of these will be flagged by
 * TypeScript.
 *
 * Your task is to update the type AsStringType to accept the types
 * it is being used with
