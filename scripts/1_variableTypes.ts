/* Types make sure our variables are what we expect them to be, which helps to
 * avoid weird bugs.
 *
 * This script fails because numA is a string, which means numA + numB is also a string,
 * and TypeScript won't let you assign it to sum, which is a number.
 *
 * You can fix the problem by changing numA to a number.
 *
 * Also try seeing what happens if you remove the 'number' type from 'sum' -
 * this will compile successfully, but we're going to get the wrong outcome. This is
 * an example of why the types in TypeScript are so helpful.
 *
 * Typescript prevents us from making silly mistakes by causing the compilation to fail
 * when rules are violated. But it doesn't cover everything, which is why it's important
 * to use it in conjunction with linting.
